It is increasingly recognized that pathway analyses, a joint test of association between the outcome and a group of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a biological pathway, could potentially complement single-SNP analysis and provide additional insights for the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Building upon existing P-value combining methods, we propose a class of highly flexible pathway analysis approaches based on an adaptive rank truncated product statistic that can effectively combine evidence of associations over different SNPs and genes within a pathway. The statistical significance of the pathway-level test statistics is evaluated using a highly efficient permutation algorithm that remains computationally feasible irrespective of the size of the pathway and complexity of the underlying test statistics for summarizing SNP- and gene-level associations. 

The main functions in this package are
\code{\link{sARTP}} when only summary level data are available,
\code{\link{rARTP}} when genotype data are available, and
\code{\link{warm.start}} for computing gene and pathway p-values when previously save information is available.
