\title{
  Single-marker meta-analysis
}
\description{
  Perform the single-marker meta-analysis with inflation adjustment. The inverse-variance weighting approach is used. 
}
\usage{
  meta(summary.files, lambda = NULL, sel.snps = NULL, only.meta=TRUE, ambig.by.AF=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{summary.files}{
a character vector of file names containing the summary results of SNPs included in one or multiple studies. Each file must be able to be read by \code{\link[utils]{read.table}}. Each file must have columns called "SNP", "RefAllele", "EffectAllele", "BETA", and at least one of "SE", "P".
}
  \item{lambda}{
a numeric vector of inflation factors. Each file in \code{summary.files} should have one inflation factor specified in \code{lambda}. \code{NULL} if inflation is not adjusted. 
}
  \item{sel.snps}{
a character vector of SNPs to be used in meta-analysis. The default is \code{NULL}, i.e., all SNPs are used. 
}
\item{only.meta}{
\code{TRUE} if do not returned individual summary data. The default is TRUE. 
}  
\item{ambig.by.AF}{TRUE or FALSE to align SNPs with ambiguous alleles by allele frequency
    (see \code{\link{options}}). The default is FALSE. 
}
}
\details{
  The inverse-variance method is used by assuming a fixed effect model. The standard error is rescaled by \code{sqrt{lambda}}. 
}
\value{
\code{meta} returns a list containing 
\item{meta.stat}{a data frame of summary statistics from meta-analysis. The summary statistics of individual studies specified in \code{summary.files} are also returned in the data frame if \code{only.meta} is \code{FALSE}. The standard error of individual studies are rescaled by \code{sqrt{lambda}}. }
\item{conf.snps}{a character vector of SNPs with conflictive allele information. }
